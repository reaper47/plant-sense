Plant Sense is the companion app for the Arduino project of
the same name to measure the soil moisture of your plants.

Why? To know whether the plant is thirsty.

The hardware transmits soil moisture, and ambient temperature/humidity
via Bluetooth. The app connects to the Bluetooth and displays the 
latest readings.
